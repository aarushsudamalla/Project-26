Mac and cheese goes back a lot further than people think. The earliest written recipe for mac and cheese was found in a book called The Forme of Cury, which was published circa 1390. That was the go-to cookbook for the royal court of Richard II and Queen Elizabeth I, so that would have been the cookbook that his and her cooks were using.”

Ken Albala, history professor at the University of the Pacific and author of numerous books about the history of food, including Food in Early Modern Europe, The Lost Art of Real Cooking and Eating Right in the Renaissance, notes that there are also some Italian mac and cheese recipes from around that same time period. “There are recipes in the 14th century Italian manuscript cookbooks,” he says, adding that in The Decameron, a collection of novellas by 14th-century Italian author Giovanni Boccaccio, “there’s the land of Bengodi, where they roll macaroni down a mountain of parmesan cheese into people’s mouths.” Sounds pleasant!
